# TR-4073-setup
TR-4073: Secure Unified Authenticaton is an official NetApp technical report that covers LDAP for UNIX user authentication, Kerberized NFS, NFSv4 and various other tasks for clustered Data ONTAP and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode.

This repository contains the setup scripts that were posted in that TR for setup and configuration of clients and servers. The scripts were moved out of the TR to allow for open source modification as well as reducing the overall size of the TRs.

These scripts are not officially supported by NetApp in any way and should be tested thoroughly before running in any production environment.

The intent of these scripts is to make setup and configuration of LDAP and Kerberos easier.
